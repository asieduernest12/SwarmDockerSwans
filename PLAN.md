## Steps & Status

| Step | Description | Status |
|------|-------------|--------|
| 1 | Start DIND cluster manager | ✅ |
| 2 | Initialize Swarm manager via `post_start` hook | ✅ |
| 3 | Launch and healthcheck worker nodes A, B, C | ✅ |
| 4 | Join workers to the Swarm cluster | ✅ |
| 5 | Create overlay network `swarm-net` | ✅ |
| 6 | Deploy services with placement constraints per node | ✅ |
| 7 | Add Docker Registry UI services | ✅ |
| 8 | Configure Caddy Docker proxy for routing | ✅ |
| 9 | Test inter-node connectivity & service discovery | ✅ |
| 10 | Final documentation & cleanup | ✅ |

## Example: Caddy Docker Proxy Label

Add labels to your Express app services for Caddy routing:
```yaml
# app service
labels:
  - 'caddy=app.localhost:80'
  - caddy.reverse_proxy={{upstreams 3001}}

# app2 service
labels:
  - 'caddy=app2.localhost:80'
  - caddy.reverse_proxy={{upstreams 3002}}
```
This exposes the services at `http://app.localhost` and `http://app2.localhost` via Caddy.

---

## Final Test
- [x] Start all nodes
- [x] Exec into one node's container (e.g., `services-node-c`)
- [x] curl http://app.localhost and curl http://app2.localhost from different nodes
- [x] Confirm successful responses
